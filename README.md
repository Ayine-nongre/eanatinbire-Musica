## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the building process i was able to further deepen my understanding of flexbox and i learned the use of animations,transitions,-webkit and adding scroll or overflow features to divs

### Continued development

I would be looking more into the use of animations and -webkits
